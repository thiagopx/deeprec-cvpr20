### Fast(er) Reconstruction of Shredded Text Documents via Self-Supervised Deep Asymmetric Metric Learning

![Overview](github/image.png)

This repository comprises datasets and source codes used in our [CVPR 2020 paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Paixao_Faster_Reconstruction_of_Shredded_Text_Documents_via_Self-Supervised_Deep_Asymmetric_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf).

#### Preparing the enviroment with virtualenv
Main dependencies:

* python 3.6
* tensorflow-gpu==1.10.1
* scikit-image==0.15.0
* scikit-learn==0.23.11
* opencv-python==3.3.1.11
* numba

For a fully-automatic setup of the virtual environment (tested on Linux Ubuntu 18.04), set the variable `BASE_DIR` in `scripts/install.sh` to a valid directory, and then run `source scripts/install.sh`.

You should have sudo privileges to run properly the installation script.
By default, the virtual environment will be created at `$BASE_DIR/envs/deeprec-cvpr20`. When finishing, the script will automatically activate the just created environment.

#### Download the datasets

The datasets comprise the (i) integral documents where the small samples are extracted and (ii) the mechanically-shredded documents collections D1 and D2 used in the tests. To download them, just run `bash scripts/get_dataset.sh`.

It will create a directory `datasets` in the local directory.

#### Demo

A reconstruction demo is available by running `python demo.py`. By default, the script uses a pretrained model available in the `traindata` directory. Here is an example of output of the demo script:

 For details of the parameters, you may run `python demo.py --help`.

#### Reproducing the experiments
To ease replicability, we created bash scripts with the commands used in each experiment. You can just run `bash scripts/experiment<ID>.sh` replacing `<ID>` by 1, 2, or 3. As described in the paper, each id corresponds to:

* 1: single-reconstruction experiment
* 2: multi-reconstruction experiment
* 3: sensitivity analysis

Results are stored as `.json` files containing, among other things, the solution, the initial permutation of the shreds, accuracy, and times. The files generated by the experiments 1 and 3 are at `results/proposed` and `results/sib18`, while those generated by the experiment 2 are at `results/proposed_multi` and `results/sib18_multi`. Results can be visualized through the scripts in the `charts` directory`.
